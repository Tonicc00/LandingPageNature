This is a copy and "translation" of the template I found out there. Template was originaly written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and
I translated it to React. I thought it would be fun and also good way to exercise my skills with React. 
The page has a navbar which shows up when menu icon is clicked and there are two paths; Home page and Projects page.

In this project I used useState hook to show Navbar on click and connected pages with react-router-dom.
The purpose of the page is to show wonders of nature, arctic part mostly.
